This is still experimental and may cause bugs because of your screen/monitor resolution. I recommend you to at least know how to adjust config files before donwloading this.
Some things you may need to adjust are:
- The offset (both X and Y)
- Amplification/Intensity (to not get cut by the window)
- radius

How to install:

1st install glava (duh)
The install commands might be different depending on the distro

2nd clone the repository
type this in your terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/2zx3/dotfiles
```
then type

```
cp ~/dotfiles/glava ~/.config/
```

that is it pretty much cya
